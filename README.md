# Reddit-Comments by default

I made this script to switch the main and the comments links on reddit, so that you/extensions opens the submission in the comments page.
I would recommend using it with Reddit Enhancement Suite, so that the sub contents is embeded in the page.

( No pretentions here, just a script "on the fly" ... )

# Install

Well ... It's a Tampermonkey script
You can copy/paste it or import it.


# Remarks

The code is still messy, but i'll improve and clean it over time !
